## :memo: Description

I developed a site which contains Semantic HTML. Writing semantic HTML makes code easier to understand, making the source code more readable for other developers. 
Screen readers and browsers can interpret Semantic HTML better, which makes it more accessible.

I used Figma file to planning and I designed it according to the desired dimensions. You can test this project by following [this link](https://ebrar-nft-site.netlify.app/).

### :dart: What I've Aimed to Work on?

- **_Semantic HTML_**
- **_Hover and active states using pseudo selectors_**
- **_Specificity_**
- **_Compound selectors (and when to avoid them)_**
- **_Inline - block_**
- **_Multiple classes on one element_**
